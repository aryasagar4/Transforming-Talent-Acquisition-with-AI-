As Jade continues to expand its business, our Talent Acquisition (TA) process must evolve to keep pace. Traditionally, the TA process has been manual, tedious, and inefficient — resulting in lost productivity and delays in hiring the right talent.
This project leverages Workato Genie, Slack, and Agentic AI (powered by Anthropic Claude) to build a next-generation TA assistant that automates repetitive workflows, ensures consistency, and provides actionable insights.

**Introduction**

The Talent Acquisition team faces several challenges in hiring the right talent quickly and efficiently:
1. Resume Screening – Filtering hundreds of resumes against a job description is slow and inconsistent.
2. Resume Standardization – Client-facing resumes must follow Jade’s standard format, requiring cleanup, redaction, and formatting.
3. Interview Scheduling & Coordination – Manual coordination consumes significant effort in aligning schedules, handling reschedules, and sending reminders.
4. Post-Offer Candidate Engagement – Candidates must be kept “warm” until joining with personalized communications, onboarding material, and regular check-ins.

This project introduces an Agentic AI-driven TA Assistant that addresses these gaps by automating routine tasks, improving decision-making, and creating a seamless recruiter experience.
